## Personal Fouls: A NFL Arrest Data Visualization 

#### Overview

It is often difficult to balance being an NFL fan with being a socially conscious person. Fantasy football in particular is a real minefield for those who try to avoid drafting morally questionable players.  The NFLArrest.com API offers a comprehensive look at arrest records, organized by crime, by team, by player and by position.  Personal Fouls uses these data points to explore NFL arrests, focusing particularly on players in fantasy-relevant positions.  

#### Functionality and MVPs

•	Users can see a football field populated by dots representing players with arrest records; hovering over the dots will reveal the player’s name 

•	Dots are color-coded by position, with opacity of the color corresponding to the number of arrests (i.e. blue for QBs, opaque blue for a QB with many arrests, transparent blue for a QB with one)

•	Users can toggle between this chart and a list

•	Users can refine by type of arrest
