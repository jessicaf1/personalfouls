## Personal Fouls: A NFL Arrest Data Visualization 

#### Overview

It is difficult to balance being an NFL fan with being a socially conscious person. Personal Fouls can alleviate some of that guilt by mapping out NFL arrest records, allowing NFL fans to identify players to avoid rooting for or picking in a fantasy draft.  The NFLArrest.com API offers a comprehensive look at arrest records, organized by crime, by team, by player and by position.  Personal Fouls uses these data points to explore NFL arrests, focusing particularly on offensive players with two or more arrests.   

#### Features

•	Users can see and interact with a football field populated by dots representing players with arrest records; hovering over the dots reveals the player’s name.

•	Dots are color-coded by position, with opacity of the color corresponding to the number of arrests.

•	Users can refine by type of arrest, team and position.

• D3 used to create animation and hovering effects.
